# <img src="assets/satty.svg" height="42"> Satty: Modern Screenshot Annotation. 

Satty is a screenshot annotation tool inspired by [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) and [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/).

![](assets/usage.gif)

Satty has been created to provide the following improvements over existing screenshot annotation tools:

- very simple and easy to understand toolset (like Swappy)
- fullscreen annotation mode and post shot cropping (like Flameshot)
- working on wlroots based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, River, ...)
- minimal, modern looking UI, thanks to GTK and Adwaita
- be a playground for new features (post window selection, post paint editing, ...)

All configuration is done via the command line interface:

```sh

      --fullscreen
          Start Satty in fullscreen mode
      --output-filename <OUTPUT_FILENAME>
          Filename to use for saving action, omit to disable saving to file
      --early-exit
          Exit directly after copy/save action
      --init-tool <TOOL>
          Select the tool on startup [default: pointer] [possible values: pointer, crop, line, arrow, rectangle, text, marker, blur, brush]
      --copy-command <COPY_COMMAND>
          Configure the command to be called on copy, for example `wl-copy`
