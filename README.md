# Satty

Satty - a Screenshot Annotation Tool inspired by [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) and [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/).

![](assets/usage.gif)

Satty has been created to provide the following improvements over existing screenshot annotation tools:

- very simple and easy to understand toolset (like Swappy)
- fullscreen annotation mode and post shot cropping (like Flameshot)
- working on wlroots based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, River, ...)
- minimal, modern looking UI, thanks to GTK and Adwaita
- be a playground for new features (post window selection, post paint editing, ...)

## Install

### Arch Linux

You can get the official Arch Linux package from the AUR:

```
yay -S satty-bin
```

### Prebuilt Sources

You can download a prebuilt binary for x86-64 on the [Satty Releases](https://github.com/gabm/satty/releases) page.


## Usage

Start by providing a filename or a screenshot via stdin and annotate using the available tools. Save to clipboard or file when finished. Tools and Interface have been kept simple.

All configuration is done via the command line interface:

```sh
Â» satty --help                
A screenshot annotation tool inspired by Swappy and Flameshot.

Usage: satty [OPTIONS] --filename <FILENAME>

          Path to input image or '-' to read from stdin.
      --fullscreen
          Start Satty in fullscreen mode.
      --output-filename <OUTPUT_FILENAME>
          Filename to use for saving action, omit to disable saving to file.
      --early-exit
          Exit directly after copy/save action.
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version

```

### wlroots based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, Wayfire, River, ...)
